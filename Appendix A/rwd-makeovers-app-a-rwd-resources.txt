# Appendix A
## RWD Resources

Responsive design web is a change that is more reflective of the web. All our published information--from pages to apps, images to video -- adapts to the devices and experience of the user, but it also changes how we build for the internet. 

These changes can be simple things like an HTML module or scale images to complex, non-trivial things like overhauling our workflows or changing up how we interact with clients and stakeholders.  

This appendix presents resources on a wide range of topics from strategy to tools whose goals is to help provide a context of the responsive web and how to aid in making solid starts in making great responsive sites.
